# Objective
The goal of this project is to extract detailed and structured information about movies from IMDb â€” a widely trusted and comprehensive source of movie data. Specifically, we aim to gather data such as the movie title, genre, release year, and IMDb rating.

This structured dataset will then be stored in a database, enabling easy access and manipulation for further analysis. By organizing and structuring this data, we unlock its potential for exciting applications like building recommendation systems, conducting trend analyses, or creating visualizations to understand movie ratings and genre popularity over time.

This will help answering  questions like:

Which genres have consistently high ratings over the years?
How have average movie ratings evolved over decades?
What are the key characteristics of top-rated movies?
This project will lay the foundation for these kinds of insights by efficiently collecting, organizing, and storing movie data from IMDb.
