## Objective
The goal of this project is to extract detailed and structured information about movies from IMDb — a widely trusted and comprehensive source of movie data. Specifically, we aim to gather data such as the movie title, genre, release year, and IMDb rating. Additionally, we will enrich this dataset by integrating it with a supplementary movie dataset from Kaggle, creating a comprehensive data source for further analysis.

This structured dataset will then be stored in a database, enabling easy access and manipulation. By organizing and structuring this data, we unlock its potential for applications such as building recommendation systems, conducting trend analyses, and creating visualizations to understand movie ratings and genre popularity over time.

The project will support answering questions such as:

Which genres have consistently high ratings over the years?
How have average movie ratings evolved over decades?
What are the key characteristics of top-rated movies?
This project will lay the foundation for these kinds of insights by efficiently collecting, organizing, and storing movie data from IMDb and Kaggle.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Defining Requirements
First, we will define our requirements by identifying the specific data fields to be extracted from IMDb and Kaggle. These fields may include:

Title: The name of the movie.
Release Year: The year the movie was released.
Genres: The movie's genres (e.g., drama, action, comedy).
IMDb Rating: The average rating given by users.
Runtime: The length of the movie.
Summary/Description: A brief synopsis of the movie.
We will also consider attributes from the Kaggle dataset that may include:

Additional movie metrics (e.g., box office revenue, director, actors, production companies, etc.).
Once we have a clear understanding of the data needed, we will decide on the format for storing the extracted information. Given the large dataset, we will choose a MySQL database to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Web Scraper
We will set up a web scraper using appropriate libraries and tools:

BeautifulSoup will be used for parsing and navigating HTML content to scrape static pages.
The setup will include sending HTTP requests to IMDb pages and parsing the responses with CSS selectors or XPath expressions to locate and extract the required data fields. We will also implement error-handling mechanisms to manage issues like CAPTCHA and potential changes in the website structure.

#### Step 3: Data Flow
The data flow will be structured into three main stages:

Scraping Raw HTML: The scraper will send requests to IMDb pages and retrieve raw HTML content.
Parsing and Extracting Data: The raw HTML will be processed using libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium to extract relevant information.
Storing Structured Data: The extracted data will be stored in a MySQL database, where we will implement data validation to ensure data integrity and avoid missing or duplicate entries.
#### Step 4: Integrating the Kaggle Dataset
After the IMDb data is extracted, we will load the Kaggle dataset (using pandas or another data-handling tool). We will clean and align both datasets to ensure a consistent format and merge them based on a common attribute like the movie title or IMDb ID.

#### Step 5: Ethics and Legalities
Before starting, we will review IMDb’s Terms of Use and their robots.txt file to ensure compliance with their scraping policies. To avoid overwhelming IMDb’s servers, we will incorporate rate-limiting by adding delays between requests. This responsible approach will help prevent the scraper from being flagged or blocked.

#### Step 6: Testing
We will conduct thorough testing to ensure the scraper operates as expected. This involves running the scraper on a small subset of IMDb pages to verify the accuracy of the data extraction. During this phase, we will debug any issues in parsing logic and add error-handling mechanisms to handle failed requests, timeouts, and unexpected website changes. We will also test the scraper's ability to handle larger datasets efficiently.

#### Step 7: Data Cleaning and Storage
After gathering and merging the data, we will clean the dataset by:

Removing duplicates.
Filling in missing values.
Standardizing data formats.
The final, cleaned data will be stored in the MySQL database for easy access and further analysis.

#### Step 8: Analyzing and Visualizing Results
Once the data is stored in the database, we will conduct analysis using SQL queries to identify trends and insights. We will use visualization tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create charts and graphs that reveal patterns, such as:

Average ratings by genre over the years.
Trends in movie ratings over decades.
Key characteristics of top-rated movies.
These visualizations and analyses will provide valuable insights into the world of film and support applications like recommendation systems and trend analysis.
